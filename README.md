# machine-learning-e2e
# End to end machine learning implementation with python language and related libraries

This project is intended to conducting research focusing on: 
1) Automating end to end machine learning tasks as much as possible
2) Adopting best tools/technoloties/practices for task #1 using python language and related libraries 

These tasks will be based on the this guide: https://github.com/scacharya/machine-learning-e2e/blob/develop/doc/impl-guide.md
