# End to end machine learning implementation with python language and related libraries

This project is intended to conducting research focusing on: 
1) Automating end to end machine learning tasks as much as possible
2) Adopting best tools/technoloties/practices for task #1 using python language and related libraries 

These tasks will be based on the this guide: https://github.com/scacharya/machine-learning-e2e/blob/develop/doc/impl-guide.md

**Getting the code** 
Execute following command to the directory of your choice (say <work-dir>)
$ git clone https://github.com/scacharya/machine-learning-e2e.git

**Basic Git operations**
in <work-dir>
1. $ git checkout develop 
2. $ git pull
3. $ git status
4. $ git add *
5. $ git push --set-upstream origin develop
6. $ git commit -m "commit comment"
