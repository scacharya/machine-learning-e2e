# End to end machine learning implementation with python language and related libraries

This project is intended to conducting research focusing on: 
1) Automating end to end machine learning tasks as much as possible
2) Adopting best tools/technoloties/practices for task #1 using python language and related libraries 

These tasks will be based on the this guide: https://github.com/scacharya/machine-learning-e2e/blob/develop/doc/impl-guide.md

**Getting the code** 
Execute following command to the directory of your choice (say work-dir)

$ git clone https://github.com/scacharya/machine-learning-e2e.git <work-dir>

This project can be executed by one of the following 2 ways: 
1) Use the interactive python notebook. The downloaded <work-dir>/interact contains ml-e2e-ex1.ipynb file. Open this file using Jupyter notenook or Jupyter lab and run it. 
  
2) Import the project in a suitable IDE (e.g. PyCharm) and follow readme.  

** Contribute ** 

If you are interested to submit some enhancements, then let me know your github id and I will add you as a collaborator. Follow standard git flow procedures tand open a pull request

-- Basic Git operations --
Perform following in <work-dir>: 
1. $ git checkout feature01 
2. $ git pull
... ... edit or add files/dirs...  
3. $ git status
4. $ git add *
5. $ git push --set-upstream origin develop
6. $ git commit -m "commit comment"

**Open a pull request**
1)Create a pull request for 'feature01' branch to be merged to master in this url: https://github.com/scacharya/machine-learning-e2e/pull/new/feature01
